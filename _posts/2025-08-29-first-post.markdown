# Hello World!

Welcome to my first post on my new Jekyll site! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and projects here.

## About This Site

This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator that's perfect for creating blogs and personal websites. Here are some reasons why I chose Jekyll:

- It's easy to set up and customize.
- It supports Markdown, which is a simple way to format text.
- It's fast and secure since it generates static HTML files.

## Testing Different Elements

Below are some elements I'm testing to see how they render on the site.

### Lists

**Unordered List:**
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

**Ordered List:**
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Code Block

Here's a simple code snippet:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")

hello_world()
```
