Welcome to my blog!
I am passionate about open-source technology and empowering teams to deliver innovative solutions. With a strong foundation in computer science and over a decade of experience as a Linux user, I specialize in designing, implementing, and optimizing IT infrastructure using open-source tools and modern technologies.
My expertise spans across Atlassian products, cloud-native environments like Docker and OCI, and embedded systems, with a focus on scalability, collaboration, and automation. As a Senior Engineer, I have led technical teams, driven project execution, and managed stakeholders in high-impact environments.
Through my consulting experience, I have collaborated with global technology leaders, helping them streamline workflows, enhance productivity, and achieve strategic IT goals. I thrive at the intersection of technology and leadership, bridging the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders to deliver results.
Beyond my professional work, I remain an avid learner—exploring everything from legacy Unix systems to cutting-edge Linux distributions—and am deeply committed to the open-source community.
Let’s connect to discuss IT innovation, team leadership, or how technology can solve complex challenges.
Stay tuned for insightful articles, tips, and discussions on the latest in technology and open-source solutions.

Happy reading!
